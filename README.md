# HiMe
A simple .py program utilising while loops, continues and breaks.

Runs in a simple script and is used simply as a way for me to slowly add to an already existing program of mine with new knowledge and cool
ideas that I might have. 

This program serves no purpose other than to test Python and to learn from implementing things I've never worked with before!
